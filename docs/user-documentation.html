        <h4 style="color: var(--hrdc-theme-alert);">Note: This is an early release&mdash;users
            without experience with web development software may not be able to access it properly
        </h4>



        <h3>Starting the software</h3>
        <p>The software can be run by entering the URL into a browser.
            For a local deployment, refer to the <a href="./dev-documentation.html#getting-started">developer
                documentation</a>.
        </p>
        <p>To access our current staging environment located <a href="https://repo1-flyio.fly.dev/">here</a>, contact 
        a developer to get credentials!</p>



        <h3>Using the software</h3>
        <p>There is an intuitive user interface that will allow users to create, read, update,
            and delete entries in the inventory.
            More complete documentation on using the software will be provided when the application
            gets further along in development.
        </p>

        <h4>Logging in</h4>
        <p>You can log in as a an admin, staff, or volunteer. Reach out 
            to your administrator to obtain the proper credentials. Or for a 
            local deployment, you can set the passwords with environment variables
            (refer to the developer documentation for more info).
        </p>

        <h4>Managing Inventory</h4>
        <p>Each inventory product must be placed in a category. You can add categories and products with the 
            "NEW PRODUCT" and "NEW CATEGORY" buttons on the home page. You can delete and update products
            by hovering over the kebab menu (3 dots) on that products page. 
        </p>
        <p>Anyone can update the current inventory level for a product with the "ADJUST STOCK" button. 
            Users can also track the amount of a product that has been donated or purchased using the "ADJUST" buttons,
            optionally adding/subtracting from the current inventory level while they are at it.
        </p>

        <h4>Email Notifications</h4>
        <p>In order to receive email notifications, the admin should click the "ADMIN SETTINGS" button
            in the top right corner of their screen and type in their email address. Then,
            email notifications will be sent whenever a product's inventory reaches 50% and 25% of the ideal
            stock. 
            The emails will come from hrdc.inventory@gmail.com
        </p>

        <h4>Exporting the inventory data to a CSV</h4>
        <p>The application allows users to transform the inventory data into a CSV file. The button 
            to perform this action is located on the REPORTS page.
        </p>
